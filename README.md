# React-News-App
A React + Node powered news app using Guardian &amp; NYTimes News API to render trending news

It was deployed on https://news2056934.wl.r.appspot.com/

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Synopsis

This project was completed as a part of my coursework for the course CSCI 571: Web Technologies at the University of Southern California, Spring 2020 under Prof. Marco Papa.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!
