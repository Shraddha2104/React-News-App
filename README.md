## Why?

**Problem**: How in the world do you keep track of all hot:fire: news happening around? Way too many! It's like a Russian novel! Help! :astonished:

**Solution**: We stream the news you need and can add them to read-it-later list to read according to your convenience. We'll source, sort, summarize and quantify different news categories

- For people with goldfish memory, who can only keep 7Â±2 people in their heads at all times! :grimacing:
- For people who're just too lazy for lookups! Sometimes you just want happenings at a glance! :star:
